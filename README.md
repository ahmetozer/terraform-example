  - IPv6
  - Internet Gateway for DualStack (IPv4 and IPv6) and Egress only gateway for IPv6
  - Subnet
    - IPv6 only Private, Public, Egress
    - DualStack  Private, Public, Egress (EKS allocated here)
  - Route Table (Private, Public, Egress)
  - Security Group
    - Default security group
    - Internal Only
  - Endpoint services  
  Enable aws services for private network and reduce ip-transit cost
    - ec2
    - ecr api
    - ecr dkr
    - sts (used by k8s service account)
    - elasticloadbalancing
    - instance_connect_endpoint (Commented due to creation time duration)
- EKS cluster (kubernetes-cluster.tf)
  - ARM architecture
  - IPv6
  - OIDC
  - Node Group
        - Private
        - Public
  - ECR Pull Through Cache
  - EKS addon (vpc-cni)
  - AWS load balancer controler (kubernetes-aws-load-balancer.tf)
    Currenty this controlelr does not supported as addon, it is installed with helm
    - IAM role
    - Support private repository to run service pods at internal network (#bk5Iutho2)
    - Public Security group
      - Allow public to ALB 80, 443
      - Allow ALB to public ICMP  
      ping command will not work because incoming ICMP not enabled to prevent net scan but ICMP response enabled for connection errors.
      - Permit access to EKS
        - Allow all outgoing traffic to EKS cluster
        - Permit this sg at EKS sg to pods for  tcp/80, tcp/8080 and icmp
        - Permit EKS sg to ALB for ICMP (prevent connection hang)

- Custom ecr pull through cache and vpce enabled to use private only network.
- ALB controller installed with helm, changes made to supports to work on private nodes (no internet access)
